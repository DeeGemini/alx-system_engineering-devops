SSH Project

On this project I will be creating a new secured shell enviroment and also an RSA key. This RSA Key will contain two types of keys: Public and Private Key.
Public key can be saved on my working enviroment and can be shared publicly.
Private key should be saved somewhere safe/secured and should never be shared publicly.

Also in this project, I will be connecting to the vitual server using SSH.
